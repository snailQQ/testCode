//Binary Tree Serialization
//
//        16% Accepted
//        Design an algorithm and write code to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. Writing the tree to a file is called 'serialization' and reading back from the file to reconstruct the exact same binary tree is 'deserialization'.
//
//        There is no limit of how you deserialize or serialize a binary tree, you only need to make sure you can serialize a binary tree to a string and deserialize this string to the original structure.
//
//        Have you met this question in a real interview? Yes
//        Example
//        An example of testdata: Binary tree {3,9,20,#,#,15,7}, denote the following structure:
//
//        3
//        / \
//        9  20
//        /  \
//        15   7
//        Our data serialization use bfs traversal. This is just for when you got wrong answer and want to debug the input.
//
//        You can use other method to do serializaiton and deserialization.
